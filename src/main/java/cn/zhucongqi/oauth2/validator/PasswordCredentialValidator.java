 * 4.3.  Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant
 * The resource owner password credentials grant type is suitable in
   cases where the resource owner has a trust relationship with the
   client, such as the device operating system or a highly privileged

   application.  The authorization server should take special care when
   enabling this grant type and only allow it when other flows are not
   viable.

   This grant type is suitable for clients capable of obtaining the
   resource owner's credentials (username and password, typically using
   an interactive form).  It is also used to migrate existing clients
   using direct authentication schemes such as HTTP Basic or Digest
   authentication to OAuth by converting the stored credentials to an
   access token.

            Figure 5: Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow

   The flow illustrated in Figure 5 includes the following steps:

   (A)  The resource owner provides the client with its username and
        password.

   (B)  The client requests an access token from the authorization
        server's token endpoint by including the credentials received
        from the resource owner.  When making the request, the client
        authenticates with the authorization server.

   (C)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
        the resource owner credentials, and if valid, issues an access
        token.
        
   The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the
   following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   format per Appendix B with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP
   request entity-body:

   grant_type
         REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "password".

   username
         REQUIRED.  The resource owner username.

   password
         REQUIRED.  The resource owner password.

   scope
         OPTIONAL.  The scope of the access request as described by
         Section 3.3.

   If the client type is confidential or the client was issued client
   credentials (or assigned other authentication requirements), the
   client MUST authenticate with the authorization server as described
   in Section 3.2.1.

   For example, the client makes the following HTTP request using
   transport-layer security (with extra line breaks for display purposes
   only):

     POST /token HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

     grant_type=password&username=johndoe&password=A3ddj3w

   The authorization server MUST:

   o  require client authentication for confidential clients or for any
      client that was issued client credentials (or with other
      authentication requirements),

   o  authenticate the client if client authentication is included, and

   o  validate the resource owner password credentials using its
      existing password validation algorithm.

   Since this access token request utilizes the resource owner's
   password, the authorization server MUST protect the endpoint against
   brute force attacks (e.g., using rate-limitation or generating
   alerts)
